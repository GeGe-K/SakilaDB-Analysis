## :relaxed: Overview and Objectives
The Sakila sample database is a database designed to represent a DVD rental store. The tables of the database include film, film_category, actor, customer, rental, payment, and inventory among others.
As the analyst/BI expert, you are required to answer the following questions in Tableau to help the leads make better-informed decisions:
1. A geographical view of the distribution of stores
2. At what time does which rental store has the highest traffic?
3. Who were the top 15 actors/actresses?
4. Which months should we bring in the horror films?
5. What is the total payment for each customer?
